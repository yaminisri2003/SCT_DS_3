Population Distribution Visualization - Task 3

This project is part of my SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship (Task 3).  
It focuses on visualizing global population trends using data from the World Bank.

Files Included

- `world_bank_population.csv` – Dataset containing population data of various countries
- `population_visualization.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and visualizations

Key Tasks

- Cleaning and preparing World Bank population data
- Analyzing population trends across countries and years
- Creating visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and area charts

Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional for interactive plots)

How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open `population_visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook to explore population patterns and visuals.

This project helped me practice real-world data handling and storytelling through visualizations.
